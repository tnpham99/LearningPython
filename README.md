# This is the Repo to learn Python for Tram Pham

## Instruction

Code committed by Tram Pham while working on assignments should go to branch `main`. However, after finishing the assignment, Tram should create a Pull Request to branch `good_code` for Duc Le to review and approve. Only after resolving all comments from Duc Le in the Pull Request that the code can be merged to `good_code` and the assignment is considered completed.
